title: FLAC Conversion
---

## Goal

Develop processing pipeline to save native data formats to FLAC.

This will include three sub tasks:

-   Establish a list of what the native file formats are that we want to evaluate going from native to FLAC.

-   Determine the level of effort to convert the formats listed in subtask 1 to FLAC and who will complete that work.

-   Create processing code to convert identified native file types to FLAC.
